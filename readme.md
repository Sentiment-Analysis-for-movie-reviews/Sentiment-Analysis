## Requirements

install all dependencies

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Processing

The downloaded file ```training-dataset.csv``` are in the `./data` folder, `data_preparation.py` process it and give the file `Black_dataset.csv`, we use the processed dataset directly in our project.

## Model Training and Evaluation

We implement our classification model with transformers [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index), we use the basic `BertForSequenceClassification` model. 

After you get the processed dataset, you can train the model with following command in the terminal:

```shell
python model_training.py
```

We evaluate our model with the F1 score, the trained model in each epoch will be saved in `./checkpoints` and the best will be saved in `./model/Best_eval.model`

## UI

We designed the UI to show the function of our model, we implement the backend with `FastAPI` and the frontend with `streamlit`.

To start the backend server, please run:

```shell
python ./Web_App/backend/main.py
```

To start the visualizate UI, please open a new terminal and run:

```shell
streamlit run ./Web_App/frontend/Hello.py 
```

you will get the UI web link, please click the link to test our model.
